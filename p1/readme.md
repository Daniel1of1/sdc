The jupyter notebook is copied over from `../CarND-LaneLines-P1` and editted to complete tasks.

The input images / test data are all referenced from the afformentioned, hence I've prepended a lot of the paths in the notebook with `../CarND-LaneLines-P1`.

To start jupyter notebook please run 
```sh
docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -v `pwd`:/src udacity/carnd-term1-starter-kit
```
from _this_ directory.

The notebook to review is in `review/`
